### Can I share the logs for the operator application ?

Yes, it would be very helpful if you took the local logfile for
the operator apps and [pasted it](https://gist.github.com/) to share
in the github issue.

You can find our log files on disk for

 - MacOS : `~/Library/Application Support/$APP_NAME/optoolco/logs.nldj`
 - Windows : `%appdata%\$APP_NAME\optoolco\logs.nldj`
 - Linux : `~/.config/$APP_NAME/optoolco/logs.nldj`

The `$APP_NAME` is one of ( `Operator`, `Buckets`, `Data` , `Functions` )
